# Overview
This task involves implementing the LSPSearchAPI interface, which defines core methods for LSP-compatible code search functionalities. Each method in the interface is designed to handle specific use cases for searching, and navigating, within a workspace. 

# Task

Supported languages:
- typescript/javascript 

#### Code Reference:
```python

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Dict, Optional


class LSPSearchAPI(ABC):
   """
   Abstract base class for an LSP search API.
   """


   @abstractmethod
   def find_definition(self, symbol: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
       """
       Find the definition of a symbol.
       :param symbol: The symbol name to search for.
       :return: A dictionary with the definition location, or None if not found.
       """
       pass


   @abstractmethod
   def find_references(self, symbol: str) -> List[Dict]:
       """
       Find all references to a symbol.
       :param symbol: The symbol name to search for.
       :return: A list of references with their locations.
       """
       pass


   @abstractmethod
   def search_workspace(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
       """
       Search for occurrences of a query string across the workspace.
       :param query: The query string.
       :return: A list of search results.
       """
       pass


   @abstractmethod
   def highlight_document(self, file_path: str, symbol: str) -> List[Dict]:
       """
       Highlight occurrences of a symbol in a specific document.
       :param file_path: The path of the file to search within.
       :param symbol: The symbol to highlight.
       :return: A list of positions where the symbol occurs.
       """
       pass


   @abstractmethod
   def find_implementations(self, interface_name: str) -> List[Dict]:
       """
       Find implementations of an interface or abstract method.
       :param interface_name: The name of the interface or abstract method.
       :return: A list of implementation locations.
       """
       pass


   @abstractmethod
   def get_symbols(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
       """
       Retrieve symbols matching a query across the workspace.
       :param query: The symbol name or query to search for.
       :return: A list of matching symbols with metadata.
       """
       pass


   @abstractmethod
   def find_files_by_name(self, file_name: str) -> List[Dict]:
       """
       Find files by their name.
       :param file_name: The name of the file to search for.
       :return: A list of matching file paths.
       """
       pass
```

# Deliverables

Here’s a table organizing the tasks for each method and indexing them as separate deliverables. This can include all necessary codebase indexing or preparations. 

Databases and other tools are welcome. This is not an algorithmic task but rather “we need this functionality whatever under the hood.”

Tips: tree-sitter or zoekt 

This is acceptable to deliver at least 2 tasks. 

| Task | Method                          | Description                                                     | Deliverable                                     |
|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `find_definition(symbol)`       | Locate the definition of the given symbol in the codebase.      | Implement method, unit tests, documentation, example usage. |
| 2    | `find_references(symbol)`       | Retrieve all references to the given symbol across the workspace.| Implement method, unit tests, documentation, example usage. |
| 3    | `search_workspace(query)`       | Perform a workspace-wide search for the given query.            | Implement method, unit tests, documentation, example usage. |
| 4    | `highlight_document(file, symbol)` | Highlight all occurrences of a symbol in a specific document.   | Implement method, unit tests, documentation, example usage. |
| 5    | `find_implementations(interface)` | Identify all implementations of a specified interface or abstract method. | Implement method, unit tests, documentation, example usage. |
| 6    | `get_symbols(query)`            | Retrieve all symbols matching the query along with metadata.    | Implement method, unit tests, documentation, example usage. |
| 7    | `find_files_by_name(file_name)` | Locate files by their names within the workspace.               | Implement method, unit tests, documentation, example usage. |
