# Overview
The goal is to create (or enhance an existing) tool powered by LLMs, focusing on automating code navigation tasks. The tool should help developers quickly understand the flow of data and logic within a codebase by answering queries such as:

- “Show the data flow from endpoint /api/user to the database.”
- “Where is function X called, and what are its dependencies?”
- “Trace how request Y is processed in the business logic layer.”

NOTE: This solution is part of a larger multi-agent system, where during navigation, agents either delegate tasks to this agent or perform additional scratchpadding during the process.

# Task
The primary task is to build a functional LLM-powered navigation agent with the following capabilities. 

1. Parse the Codebase: Analyze the structure of a project, including files, modules, classes, and functions.

2. Trace Data and Logic Flows: Traverse dependencies across files and modules to identify how data flows and logic executes.

3. Answer Developer Queries: Respond to questions about code flows and dependencies with structured, actionable insights.

# Deliverables
1. A Functional LLM-Powered Navigation Agent

   - Capable of accepting queries like, `Trace the flow from endpoint /api/user to the database`
   - Parses and analyzes the project structure to identify relevant files and functions.
   - Generates a detailed, structured report showing the complete flow of logic.

Example Result:
```
- In `routes/user.js`, the endpoint `/api/user` maps to `userController.getUser`.
- In `controllers/userController.js`, `getUser` calls `userService.getUserData`.
- In `services/userService.js`, `getUserData` calls `dbAdapter.fetchUser`, which queries the database.
```

2. Output Formats

   - Markdown or XML for reporting the overall flow trajectory.

### Use Case

##### **Query**

“Show the flow of data from /api/auth/login to the database.”

##### **Agent Actions**
   - Reads the routes file (e.g., routes/auth.js) and identifies that the endpoint /login maps to authController.loginHandler.

   - Navigates to the authController, where it finds a call to AuthService.login(...).

   - Examines the AuthService to locate a call to dbAdapter.signIn(...), which interacts with the database.

   - Repeats this process until the entire flow is traced.

##### Output

Structured result with a content like:
```
- In `routes/auth.js`, the endpoint `/login` maps to `authController.loginHandler`.
- In `controllers/authController.js`, `loginHandler` calls `AuthService.login`.
- In `services/AuthService.js`, `login` calls `dbAdapter.signIn`, which queries the database.
```
