# Overview
The contest focuses on implementing the `find_references` function using **stack graphs**, a framework developed by GitHub for efficient and incremental name resolution. 

Stack graphs provide a scalable and precise way to resolve symbol references across files, making them ideal for building advanced language support in large codebases.


# Task
The primary task is to implement the `find_references` method using stack graphs. This involves:
1. **Constructing a stack graph representation** of the workspace.
2. **Resolving references through pathfinding** algorithms.
3. Providing structured results for symbol usage.

### About Stack Graphs
Stack graphs are a framework designed to model relationships between symbols, scopes, and definitions in programming languages. Developed by GitHub, they extend scope graphs by introducing a stack-based approach to manage complex scenarios, such as:
- Cross-file references.
- Type-directed name lookups.
- Shadowing and ambiguous symbols.

**Additional Resources**:
- [GitHub’s Stack Graph Documentation](https://github.github.com/stack-graph-docs/)
- [GitHub’s Stack Graph Library (Rust)](https://github.com/github/stack-graphs)
- [Tree-sitter for Parsing Codebases](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)

### Possible Implementation Steps

1. **Parse the Codebase**:
   - Convert source files into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using tools like **tree-sitter**.

2. **Build the Stack Graph**:
   - Represent definitions, references, and scopes as nodes and define relationships as edges.

3. **Resolve References**:
   - Use stack graph pathfinding algorithms to trace references to their definitions across the workspace.

4. **Return Results**:
   - Format the output with details such as:
     - File paths.
     - Line numbers.
     - Code snippets.

> For practical implementation, GitHub provides a Rust-based stack graph library, which can be integrated into your project.

### Method Specification

```python
@abstractmethod
def find_references(self, symbol: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Find all references to a symbol in the workspace using stack graphs.
    :param symbol: The symbol name to search for.
    :return: A list of dictionaries containing the reference locations and metadata.
    """
    pass
```
