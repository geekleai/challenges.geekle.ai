# Overview

Modern applications often have complex UIs, making it challenging to understand how different features and workflows interconnect. This contest focuses on building a UI functionality navigation tool that leverages AI to map and explore user interfaces automatically.

**NOTE:** This solution is part of a larger multi-agent system, where agents either delegate tasks to this agent or perform additional scratchpadding during the process.

# Task

1. **Develop a Navigation Agent**
   - Automatically generate a visual map of the UI, showing screens, components, and interactions between them.
   - Navigate through the UI by clicking buttons and following workflows.
   - Represent flows between components (e.g., button clicks leading to new screens, modals, or API calls) via screenshots.

2. **Example Queries**
   - "What happens when I press the ‘Reset Password’ button?"
   - "Which screens are affected by changes in the settings page?"

---

# Deliverables

1. **Proposal**
   - A detailed plan on how to build the clicking agent, including tools, scripts, and prompt designs.

2. **Functional Prototype**
   - An LLM-powered navigation agent capable of mapping and navigating through UIs with visual outputs.


### Expected Outcomes

Participants will design a tool that makes understanding complex UIs easier by:
- Automating the exploration of user workflows.
- Providing clear visual representations of UI interactions.
- Enhancing development and debugging processes for modern applications.
