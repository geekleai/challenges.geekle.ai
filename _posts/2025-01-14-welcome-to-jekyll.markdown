[Artipie](https://www.artipie.com) is a new binary artifact management toolkit, which is
very similar to [Nexus&trade;](https://www.sonatype.com/product-nexus-repository)
and [Artifactory&trade;](https://jfrog.com/artifactory), but with a number of important
advantages. First, it's fully open source. Second, it provides
high-availaibility out of the box (you can scale it horizontally).
Third, it supports 10+ package managers, including Maven, NuGet,
Rubygems, PyPi, Npm, Rpm, Helm, and others.
